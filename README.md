## About

This will build a Docker image for [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org). A relational database forked from MySQL.

* Configuration tweaked to use all around settings for general usage - Can be changed
* Can use official Mysql/MariaDB environment variables (MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)
* Allows for automatically creating multiple databases on container initialization and subsequent reboots
* Automatic Table/DB Upgrade support if MariaDB version has changed
* Includes MySQL Tuner inside image to optimize your configuration
* Logging with automatic rotation
* Zabbix Monitoring for metrics

Also has the capability of backing up embedded in the container based on the [tiredofit/dbbackup](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup) image which includes the following features:

* dump to local filesystem
* Backup all databases
* choose to have an MD5?SHA sum after backup for verification
* delete old backups after specific amount of time
* choose compression type (none, gz, bz, xz,zstd)
* select how often to run a dump
* select when to start the first dump, whether time of day or relative to container start time

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build <arguments> (imagename) .`
### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/mariadb)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/tiredofdit/mariadb:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-mariadb/pkgs/container/docker-mariadb)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/tiredofit/docker-mariadb:(imagetag)
```

The following image tags are available along with their tagged release based on what's written in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md):

| Version   | Container OS | Tag       |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| latest    | Alpine       | `:latest` |
| `10.11.x` | Alpine       | `:10.11`  |
| `10.10.x` | Alpine       | `:10.10`  |
| `10.9.x`  | Alpine       | `:10.9`   |
| `10.8.x`  | Alpine       | `:10.8`   |
| `10.6.x`  | Alpine       | `:10.6`   |
| `10.5.x`  | Alpine       | `:10.5`   |

#### Multi Architecture
Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work so that I can work with various hardware. To see if this image supports multiple architecures, type `docker manifest (image):(tag)`

## Configuration

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
- Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory           | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/var/lib/mysql`    | MySQL Data Directory                                           |
| `/etc/mysql/conf.d` | Optional directory to put .cnf files for additional directives |
| `/backup`           | Optional directory for backups                                 |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on an [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/alpine) base image that relies on an [init system](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for added capabilities. Outgoing SMTP capabilities are handlded via `msmtp`. Individual container performance monitoring is performed by [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org). Additional tools include: `bash`,`curl`,`less`,`logrotate`,`nano`,`vim`.

Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

The backup functionality is a subset of the [tiredofit/db-backup](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup) image. Please have a peek at the README to understand ways to use. All features have been carried over with the exception of being able to backup remote systems - It is hardcoded to connect to the MariaDB socket not requiring DB_HOST/DB_PORT variables.
